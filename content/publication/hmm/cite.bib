  abstract = {Corporate relative valuation (CRV) refers to the process of comparing a company's value from company products, core staff and other related information, so that we can assess the company's market value, which is critical for venture capital firms. Traditionally, relative valuation methods heavily rely on tedious and expensive human efforts, especially for non-publicly listed companies. However, the availability of information about company's invisible assets, such as patents, talent, and investors, enables a new paradigm for learning and evaluating corporate relative values automatically. Indeed, in this paper, we reveal that, if the companies and their core members are formed as a heterogeneous graph and the attributes of different nodes include semantically-rich multi-modal data, it is able to extract a latent embedding for each company. Along this line, we develop an end-to-end heterogeneous multi-modal graph neural network method, named HM<formula><tex>$^2$</tex></formula>. Specifically, HM<formula><tex>$^2$</tex></formula> firstly perform the representation learning for heterogeneous neighbors of input company by taking relationships among nodes into consideration, which aggregates node attributes via linkage-aware multi-head attention mechanism, rather than multi-instance based methods. Then, HM<formula><tex>$^2$</tex></formula> adopts the self-attention network to aggregate different modal embeddings for final prediction, and employs dynamic triplet loss with embeddings of competitors as the constraint.},
